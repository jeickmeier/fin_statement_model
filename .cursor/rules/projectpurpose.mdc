## Library Description

The Financial Statement Model library provides tools for:
- Building and analyzing financial statement data models
- Creating calculation graphs for financial metrics
- Importing financial data from various sources (Excel, APIs, etc.)
- Performing forecasting and scenario analysis on financial statements
- Generating reports and visualizations of financial data
- Supporting extensible financial calculations and custom metrics

The library uses a node-based graph structure where financial items are nodes and calculations define relationships between these nodes.
