# Purpose
`io/` handles all **external data interfaces**: reading raw data into the graph and
exporting model results to files, databases, or APIs.  It must stay at the edge of the
system and therefore **may import from** `fin_statement_model.core` (to build nodes) and
`statements/` (for schema awareness) but **must never be imported by** those layers.
