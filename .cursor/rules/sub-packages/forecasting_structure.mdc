# Purpose
The `forecasting` package is now a **compatibility façade** that re‑exports forecast‑related
classes from `fin_statement_model.core`.  New code should import forecast nodes directly
from `fin_statement_model.core.nodes`.  This shim exists to avoid breaking older user code
and will remain until the next major version.

The package **must contain no domain logic** – only lightweight wrappers and helpers that
delegate to core – therefore core never imports from this layer.

# Allowed Dependencies
- Core scientific stack:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
- Time series analysis:
  - statsmodels
  - pmdarima
- Machine learning:
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
  - lightgbm
- Optional heavy deps:
  - torch (PyTorch)
  - tensorflow

There is no standalone implementation here; any heavy computation lives in `core`.  The
dependencies listed below remain available for user code that still chooses to extend the
façade:

Typical responsibilities:
* Time‑series forecasting of node values (e.g. revenue growth, cash‑flow projections)
* Scenario analysis & Monte‑Carlo simulation
* Model evaluation / back‑testing helpers
