# Purpose
The `forecasting` layer provides predictive models that build on the **core graph**.  It
may import from `fin_statement_model.core` and `preprocessing` for cleaned data, but **must
not** be imported by those layers.

# Allowed Dependencies
- Core scientific stack:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
- Time series analysis:
  - statsmodels
  - pmdarima
- Machine learning:
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
  - lightgbm
- Optional heavy deps:
  - torch (PyTorch)
  - tensorflow

Typical responsibilities:
* Time‑series forecasting of node values (e.g. revenue growth, cash‑flow projections)
* Scenario analysis & Monte‑Carlo simulation
* Model evaluation / back‑testing helpers
