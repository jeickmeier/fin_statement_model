# Purpose
The `preprocessing` layer contains reusable **data‑cleaning and transformation** logic
applied *before* data is loaded into the core graph or fed to forecasting models.  It
should be completely **side‑effect‑free** (no I/O) and focus on converting raw DataFrame
inputs into normalised, type‑safe structures understood by the rest of the library.

`preprocessing/` may import from `fin_statement_model.core` (for type aliases) but **must
not import** from `io/` or `forecasting/`.
