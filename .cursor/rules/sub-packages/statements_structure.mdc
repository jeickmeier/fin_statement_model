# Purpose
The `statements` layer wraps the core graph engine with **domain‑specific helpers** for
working with financial statements (Balance Sheet, P&L, Cash‑flow, etc.).  It provides:
* Declarative statement schemas & configs
* Builders/factories that construct node graphs from those schemas
* Human‑friendly formatting & presentation utilities
* General utility functions specific to statement manipulation

`statements/` may import from `fin_statement_model.core`, but **never** from `io/` or
`forecasting/`.
