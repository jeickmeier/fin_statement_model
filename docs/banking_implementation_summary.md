# Calculate CET1 ratio
cet1_ratio = calculate_metric("common_equity_tier_1_ratio", data_nodes, "2023")

# Calculate LCR
lcr = calculate_metric("liquidity_coverage_ratio", data_nodes, "2023")
```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```python
from examples.scripts.banking_analysis_example import generate_banking_dashboard

# Generate full banking dashboard
results = generate_banking_dashboard(bank_data, "2023")

### Custom Analysis
```python
# Analyze specific metric categories
asset_quality_metrics = [
    "non_performing_loan_ratio",
    "charge_off_rate", 
    "provision_coverage_ratio"
]

for metric in asset_quality_metrics:
    value = calculate_metric(metric, data_nodes, period)
    interpretation = interpret_metric(metric_registry.get(metric), value)
    print(f"{metric}: {value:.2f}% - {interpretation['rating']}")
```
