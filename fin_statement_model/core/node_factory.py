"""Legacy shim â€“ NodeFactory has moved to ``core/node_factory/`` package.

This file remains temporarily to avoid breaking user imports during the
modular-factory refactor.  All logic has been removed; it re-exports
:class:`~fin_statement_model.core.node_factory.NodeFactory` and raises a
:class:`DeprecationWarning` once on import.

The shim will be deleted in a future minor release.
