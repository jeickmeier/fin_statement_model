    utilization.

    notes: "- Below 0.2: Very poor asset utilization, potential operational issues\n- 0.2-0.4: Low efficiency, may indicate\
      \ asset-heavy business or underutilization\n- 0.4-0.8: Adequate efficiency for many capital-intensive industries\n-\
      \ 0.8-2.0: Good to strong asset utilization, efficient operations\n- Above 2.0: Excellent efficiency, very effective\
      \ asset use\n- Highly industry-dependent - capital-intensive industries typically lower\n- Asset-light businesses (services,\
      \ retail) typically higher\n- Component of ROA analysis (ROA = Net Margin Ã— Asset Turnover)\n- Consider using average\
      \ assets for more accurate calculation\n- Declining turnover may indicate overinvestment or operational issues \n"

      \ typically lower than services\n- Consider asset age and depreciation policies\n- Low turnover may indicate recent\
      \ large capex or overcapacity\n- High turnover may indicate efficient operations or aging assets\n- Use gross PP&E for\

      \ 12.0: Excellent efficiency, very effective working capital management\n- Higher ratios indicate more efficient working\
      \ capital use\n- Negative working capital creates undefined ratio (handle separately)\n- Consider alongside cash conversion\
      \ cycle for complete picture\n- Industry-dependent - retailers typically higher than manufacturers\n- Monitor trends\
