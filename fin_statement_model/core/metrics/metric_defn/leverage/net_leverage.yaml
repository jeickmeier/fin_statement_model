      \ capital structure\n- 0.5-1.0: Higher net leverage, acceptable for stable cash flow businesses\n- 1.0-2.0: High net\
      \ leverage, requires strong cash generation\n- Above 2.0: Very high net leverage, significant financial risk\n- More\
      \ accurate than gross debt ratios as it considers cash offset\n- Negative values indicate net cash position (cash >\
      \ debt)\n- Particularly relevant for companies with significant cash holdings\n- Better reflects actual financial risk\
      \ and debt capacity\n- Consider cash accessibility and restrictions when interpreting \n"
