# Metric definition for Inventory Turnover

name: Inventory Turnover
description: Measures how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period. Shows inventory management efficiency.
inputs:
  - cost_of_goods_sold
  - inventory
formula: "cost_of_goods_sold / inventory"
tags: [efficiency, inventory_management, turnover, working_capital]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [days_inventory_outstanding, working_capital_turnover, asset_turnover]
interpretation:
  good_range: [4.0, 12.0]
  warning_below: 2.0
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 8.0
  poor_below: 1.0
  notes: |
    - Below 1.0: Very slow inventory turnover, potential obsolescence risk
    - 1.0-2.0: Slow turnover, excessive inventory investment
    - 2.0-4.0: Adequate turnover for many industries
    - 4.0-12.0: Good to strong inventory management
    - Above 12.0: Excellent turnover, very efficient inventory management
    - Higher turnover generally indicates better inventory management
    - Inverse relationship with Days Inventory Outstanding
    - Industry-dependent - grocery stores much higher than auto dealers
    - Consider seasonality and product lifecycle
    - Balance efficiency with stockout risk and customer service 
# Metric definition for Receivables Turnover

name: Receivables Turnover

inputs:
  - revenue
  - accounts_receivable
formula: "revenue / accounts_receivable"
tags: [efficiency, receivables_management, collection_efficiency, working_capital]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [days_sales_outstanding, working_capital_turnover, cash_conversion_cycle]
interpretation:
  good_range: [6.0, 18.0]
  warning_below: 3.0
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 12.0
  poor_below: 2.0
  notes: |
    - Below 2.0: Very slow collections, potential credit issues
    - 2.0-3.0: Slow collections, inefficient credit management
    - 3.0-6.0: Adequate collection efficiency for many industries
    - 6.0-18.0: Good to strong receivables management
    - Above 18.0: Excellent collections, very efficient credit management
    - Higher turnover indicates faster collections
    - Inverse relationship with Days Sales Outstanding
    - Compare to stated payment terms (e.g., Net 30 = 12x annual turnover)
    - Industry-dependent - B2B typically lower than B2C
    - Monitor trends - declining turnover may indicate credit quality issues 
# Metric definition for Payables Turnover

description: Measures how many times payables are paid over a period. Shows supplier payment efficiency and cash flow management.

  - cost_of_goods_sold
  - accounts_payable
formula: "cost_of_goods_sold / accounts_payable"
tags: [efficiency, payables_management, cash_flow_optimization, working_capital]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [days_payables_outstanding, working_capital_turnover, cash_conversion_cycle]
interpretation:
  good_range: [6.0, 15.0]
  warning_below: 3.0
  warning_above: 20.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 3.0: Very slow payments, may strain supplier relationships
    - 3.0-6.0: Slow payments, extended payment terms
    - 6.0-15.0: Balanced payment approach, good cash flow management

    - Inverse relationship with Days Payables Outstanding
    - Balance cash flow benefits with supplier relationship management
    - Consider negotiated payment terms and industry practices
    - Monitor for sudden changes that may indicate cash flow stress
