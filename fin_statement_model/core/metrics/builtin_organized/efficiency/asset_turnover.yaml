# Metric definition for Asset Turnover

name: Asset Turnover
description: Measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. Higher ratios indicate better asset utilization.
inputs:
  - revenue
  - total_assets
formula: "revenue / total_assets"
tags: [efficiency, asset_utilization, operational_efficiency, turnover]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [fixed_asset_turnover, working_capital_turnover, return_on_assets]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.8, 2.0]
  warning_below: 0.4
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 1.5
  poor_below: 0.2
  notes: |
    - Below 0.2: Very poor asset utilization, potential operational issues
    - 0.2-0.4: Low efficiency, may indicate asset-heavy business or underutilization
    - 0.4-0.8: Adequate efficiency for many capital-intensive industries
    - 0.8-2.0: Good to strong asset utilization, efficient operations
    - Above 2.0: Excellent efficiency, very effective asset use
    - Highly industry-dependent - capital-intensive industries typically lower
    - Asset-light businesses (services, retail) typically higher
    - Component of ROA analysis (ROA = Net Margin Ã— Asset Turnover)
    - Consider using average assets for more accurate calculation
    - Declining turnover may indicate overinvestment or operational issues 
# Metric definition for Fixed Asset Turnover

name: Fixed Asset Turnover
description: Measures revenue generated per dollar of fixed assets. Shows efficiency of property, plant, and equipment utilization.
inputs:
  - revenue
  - property_plant_equipment
formula: "revenue / property_plant_equipment"
tags: [efficiency, asset_utilization, fixed_asset_productivity, capital_efficiency]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [asset_turnover, working_capital_turnover, return_on_assets]
interpretation:
  good_range: [2.0, 6.0]
  warning_below: 1.0
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 4.0
  poor_below: 0.5
  notes: |
    - Below 0.5: Very poor fixed asset utilization, potential overcapacity
    - 0.5-1.0: Low efficiency, underutilized fixed assets
    - 1.0-2.0: Adequate efficiency for capital-intensive industries
    - 2.0-6.0: Good to strong fixed asset productivity
    - Above 6.0: Excellent efficiency, very effective asset use
    - Highly industry-dependent - manufacturing typically lower than services
    - Consider asset age and depreciation policies
    - Low turnover may indicate recent large capex or overcapacity
    - High turnover may indicate efficient operations or aging assets
    - Use gross PP&E for more consistent comparison across companies 
# Metric definition for Working Capital Turnover

name: Working Capital Turnover
description: Measures revenue generated per dollar of working capital. Shows efficiency of working capital utilization.
inputs:
  - revenue
  - working_capital
formula: "revenue / working_capital"
tags: [efficiency, working_capital_management, capital_utilization, turnover]
units: times
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [asset_turnover, cash_conversion_cycle, current_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [4.0, 12.0]
  warning_below: 2.0
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 8.0
  poor_below: 1.0
  notes: |
    - Below 1.0: Very poor working capital efficiency
    - 1.0-2.0: Low efficiency, excessive working capital investment
    - 2.0-4.0: Adequate efficiency for many industries
    - 4.0-12.0: Good to strong working capital utilization
    - Above 12.0: Excellent efficiency, very effective working capital management
    - Higher ratios indicate more efficient working capital use
    - Negative working capital creates undefined ratio (handle separately)
    - Consider alongside cash conversion cycle for complete picture
    - Industry-dependent - retailers typically higher than manufacturers
    - Monitor trends - improving efficiency indicates better management 
# Metric definition for Capital Intensity

name: Capital Intensity
description: Measures assets required per dollar of revenue. Shows capital requirements for business operations.
inputs:
  - total_assets
  - revenue
formula: "total_assets / revenue"
tags: [efficiency, capital_requirements, asset_intensity, business_model]
units: ratio
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [asset_turnover, fixed_asset_turnover, working_capital_turnover]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.5, 2.0]
  warning_below: null
  warning_above: 4.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.5: Very low capital intensity, asset-light business model
    - 0.5-2.0: Moderate capital intensity, balanced business model
    - 2.0-4.0: High capital intensity, asset-heavy operations
    - Above 4.0: Very high capital intensity, significant asset requirements
    - Inverse of asset turnover ratio
    - Lower ratios generally indicate more efficient business models
    - Industry-dependent - utilities much higher than software companies
    - Consider asset age and depreciation policies
    - High intensity may indicate barriers to entry but lower returns
    - Useful for comparing business model efficiency across companies
