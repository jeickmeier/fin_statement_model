# Metric definition for Cash Flow Return on Assets

name: Cash Flow Return on Assets
description: Measures operating cash flow relative to total assets. Shows cash generation efficiency per dollar of assets.
inputs:
  - operating_cash_flow
  - total_assets
formula: "operating_cash_flow / total_assets * 100"
tags: [cash_flow, asset_efficiency, returns, cash_productivity]

  poor_below: 1.0
  notes: |
    - Below 1%: Very poor cash generation from assets
    - 1-3%: Low cash productivity, potential operational issues
    - 3-8%: Adequate cash generation for many capital-intensive industries
    - 8-20%: Good to strong cash productivity from assets
    - Above 20%: Excellent cash generation efficiency
    - More reliable than ROA as it uses actual cash flows

# Metric definition for Cash Flow to Capital Expenditures

name: Cash Flow to Capital Expenditures
description: Measures operating cash flow relative to capital expenditures. Shows ability to fund capex from operations.
inputs:
  - operating_cash_flow
  - capital_expenditures
formula: "operating_cash_flow / abs(capital_expenditures)"
tags: [cash_flow, capital_efficiency, self_funding, capex_coverage]
units: times
category: cash_flow
related_metrics: [free_cash_flow_margin, cash_flow_coverage, asset_turnover]
interpretation:
  good_range: [2.0, 5.0]
  warning_below: 1.2
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 3.0
  poor_below: 1.0
  notes: |
    - Below 1.0: OCF insufficient to cover capex, external funding needed
    - 1.0-1.2: Tight coverage, vulnerable to cash flow volatility
    - 1.2-2.0: Adequate coverage, some financial flexibility
    - 2.0-5.0: Good to strong coverage, self-funding capability
    - Above 5.0: Excellent coverage, significant financial flexibility
    - Shows ability to fund growth and maintenance capex internally
    - Critical for assessing financial independence and flexibility
    - Consider maintenance vs. growth capex when interpreting
    - Low ratios may indicate need for external financing
    - High ratios suggest strong cash generation or low capex intensity 
# Metric definition for Free Cash Flow to Operating Cash Flow

name: Free Cash Flow to Operating Cash Flow
description: Measures percentage of operating cash flow available after capital expenditures. Shows capital intensity impact.
inputs:
  - free_cash_flow
  - operating_cash_flow
formula: "free_cash_flow / operating_cash_flow * 100"

  good_range: [60.0, 90.0]
  warning_below: 30.0
  warning_above: null

  poor_below: 10.0
  notes: |
    - Below 10%: Very high capital intensity, most OCF consumed by capex
    - 10-30%: High capital requirements, limited free cash generation
    - 30-60%: Moderate capital intensity, adequate free cash flow
    - 60-90%: Good free cash conversion, manageable capex requirements
    - Above 90%: Excellent conversion, low capital intensity or mature assets
    - Shows what percentage of OCF remains after necessary capex
    - Lower ratios indicate higher capital intensity
    - Consider maintenance vs. growth capex when interpreting
    - Negative FCF results in negative ratio
    - Industry-dependent - utilities typically lower than software companies
