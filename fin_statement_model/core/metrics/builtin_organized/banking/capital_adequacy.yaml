# Metric definition for Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio

name: Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio
description: Common Equity Tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Primary regulatory capital ratio.
inputs:
  - common_equity_tier_1
  - total_risk_weighted_assets
formula: "common_equity_tier_1 / total_risk_weighted_assets * 100"
tags: [banking, capital_adequacy, cet1_ratio, regulatory_capital]
units: percentage
category: banking_capital_adequacy
related_metrics: [tier_1_capital_ratio, total_capital_ratio, tier_1_leverage_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [9.0, 15.0]
  warning_below: 7.0
  warning_above: null
  excellent_above: 12.0
  poor_below: 6.0
  notes: |
    - Below 6.0%: Below regulatory minimum, potential enforcement action
    - 6.0-7.0%: Minimum regulatory requirement, limited flexibility
    - 7.0-9.0%: Above minimum but below well-capitalized threshold

    - Above 15.0%: Very strong capital position, significant buffer
    - Regulatory minimum is 4.5% plus buffers (typically 7.0-8.5% total)
    - Well-capitalized threshold is typically 6.5%
    - G-SIBs have additional buffer requirements
    - Stress test results may require higher levels
    - Consider capital planning and distribution restrictions
