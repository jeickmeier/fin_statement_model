  - total_loans
formula: "non_performing_loans / total_loans * 100"
tags: [banking, asset_quality, credit_risk, npl_ratio]
units: percentage
category: banking_asset_quality
related_metrics: [charge_off_rate, provision_coverage_ratio, allowance_to_loans_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.5, 2.0]
  warning_below: null
  warning_above: 3.0

  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.5%: Excellent asset quality, very low credit risk

    - 2.0-3.0%: Elevated credit risk, requires monitoring
    - 3.0-5.0%: High credit risk, potential asset quality issues
    - Above 5.0%: Very high credit risk, significant asset quality concerns
    - Industry and economic cycle dependent
    - Compare to peer banks and historical averages
    - Consider loan portfolio composition and geographic concentration
    - Rising NPL ratios may indicate deteriorating credit conditions
    - Regulatory attention typically increases above 3-4% 
# Metric definition for Charge-Off Rate

name: Charge-Off Rate
description: Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Measures actual credit losses realized by the bank.
inputs:
  - net_charge_offs
  - average_total_loans
formula: "net_charge_offs / average_total_loans * 100"
tags: [banking, asset_quality, credit_losses, charge_offs]
units: percentage
category: banking_asset_quality
related_metrics: [non_performing_loan_ratio, provision_for_credit_losses, recovery_rate]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.2, 1.0]
  warning_below: null
  warning_above: 1.5
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.2%: Very low charge-offs, excellent credit performance
    - 0.2-1.0%: Normal charge-off levels for most commercial banks
    - 1.0-1.5%: Elevated charge-offs, monitor credit trends
    - 1.5-3.0%: High charge-offs, significant credit stress
    - Above 3.0%: Very high charge-offs, severe credit deterioration
    - Typically annualized for quarterly reporting
    - Compare to provision expense to assess adequacy
    - Consider loan portfolio mix - credit cards typically higher
    - Economic cycle and geographic factors impact levels
    - Consistent with peer banks and historical norms important 
# Metric definition for Provision Coverage Ratio

name: Provision Coverage Ratio
description: Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans. Shows adequacy of loss reserves.
inputs:
  - allowance_for_loan_losses
  - non_performing_loans
formula: "allowance_for_loan_losses / non_performing_loans * 100"
tags: [banking, asset_quality, provision_coverage, loss_reserves]
units: percentage
category: banking_asset_quality
related_metrics: [non_performing_loan_ratio, allowance_to_loans_ratio, charge_off_rate]

  warning_below: 60.0
  warning_above: 200.0
  excellent_above: 120.0
  poor_below: 50.0
  notes: |
    - Below 50%: Inadequate provision coverage, potential reserve deficiency
    - 50-80%: Below average coverage, may need reserve build
    - 80-150%: Adequate to strong provision coverage
    - Above 200%: Very high coverage, potentially over-reserved
    - Higher coverage ratios indicate more conservative reserving
    - Consider collateral values and recovery expectations
    - CECL accounting may result in higher coverage ratios
    - Compare to peer banks and regulatory guidance
    - Economic uncertainty may warrant higher coverage
    - Monitor trends - declining coverage may indicate inadequate reserves
