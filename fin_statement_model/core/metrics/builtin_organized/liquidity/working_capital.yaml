# Metric definition for Days Sales Outstanding

name: Days Sales Outstanding
description: Measures average collection period for accounts receivable. Shows efficiency of credit and collection policies.
inputs:
  - accounts_receivable
  - revenue
formula: "(accounts_receivable / revenue) * 365"
tags: [working_capital, receivables_management, collection_efficiency, cash_conversion]
units: days
category: efficiency
related_metrics: [days_inventory_outstanding, days_payables_outstanding, cash_conversion_cycle]
interpretation:
  good_range: [30, 60]
  warning_above: 90

  notes: |
    - Below 30 days: Very efficient collections, strong credit management
    - 30-60 days: Good collection efficiency for most industries
    - 60-90 days: Adequate but could be improved, monitor trends
    - 90-120 days: Slow collections, potential credit issues
    - Above 120 days: Very slow collections, significant working capital tie-up
    - Highly industry-dependent - B2B typically higher than B2C
    - Compare to stated payment terms (e.g., Net 30, Net 60)
    - Rising DSO may indicate credit quality deterioration
    - Consider seasonality and customer concentration
    - Use average receivables for more accurate calculation when possible 
# Metric definition for Days Inventory Outstanding

name: Days Inventory Outstanding
description: Measures average inventory holding period. Shows efficiency of inventory management and working capital utilization.
inputs:
  - inventory
  - cost_of_goods_sold
formula: "(inventory / cost_of_goods_sold) * 365"
tags: [working_capital, inventory_management, operational_efficiency, cash_conversion]
units: days
category: efficiency

  notes: |
    - Below 30 days: Very efficient inventory management, lean operations
    - 30-90 days: Good inventory efficiency for most industries
    - 90-180 days: Adequate but monitor for improvement opportunities
    - 180-365 days: Slow inventory turnover, significant working capital tie-up
    - Above 365 days: Very slow turnover, potential obsolescence risk
    - Highly industry-dependent - manufacturing typically higher than retail
    - Consider product lifecycle and seasonality patterns
    - Rising DIO may indicate demand weakness or poor inventory planning
    - Balance efficiency with stockout risk and customer service
    - Use average inventory for more accurate calculation when possible 
# Metric definition for Days Payables Outstanding

name: Days Payables Outstanding
description: Measures average payment period for accounts payable. Shows efficiency of supplier payment management and cash flow optimization.
inputs:
  - accounts_payable
  - cost_of_goods_sold
formula: "(accounts_payable / cost_of_goods_sold) * 365"
tags: [working_capital, payables_management, cash_flow_optimization, supplier_relations]
units: days
category: efficiency

  warning_below: 15
  warning_above: 120
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 15 days: Very fast payments, may miss cash flow optimization opportunities
    - 15-30 days: Fast payments, good supplier relations but limited cash benefit
    - 30-60 days: Balanced approach, good cash flow management
    - 60-120 days: Extended payment terms, maximize cash flow benefit
    - Above 120 days: Very extended terms, potential supplier relationship strain
    - Higher DPO generally better for cash flow (within reason)
    - Must balance cash flow benefits with supplier relationships
    - Consider payment terms negotiated with suppliers
    - Sudden increases may indicate cash flow stress
    - Industry practices and supplier power affect optimal levels 
# Metric definition for Cash Conversion Cycle

name: Cash Conversion Cycle
description: Measures time to convert investments in inventory and receivables into cash. Key working capital efficiency metric.
inputs:
  - accounts_receivable
  - revenue
  - inventory
  - cost_of_goods_sold
  - accounts_payable
# Formula combines the three component metrics
formula: "((accounts_receivable / revenue) * 365) + ((inventory / cost_of_goods_sold) * 365) - ((accounts_payable / cost_of_goods_sold) * 365)"
tags: [working_capital, cash_conversion, operational_efficiency, liquidity_management]
units: days
category: efficiency

interpretation:
  good_range: [30, 90]
  warning_above: 150
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  warning_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 30 days: Excellent working capital efficiency, strong cash generation
    - 30-90 days: Good working capital management for most industries
    - 90-150 days: Adequate but opportunities for improvement
    - 150-250 days: Slow cash conversion, significant working capital tie-up
    - Above 250 days: Very slow conversion, potential cash flow stress
    - Negative values indicate suppliers finance working capital (very favorable)
    - Lower is generally better for cash flow and liquidity
    - Highly industry-dependent - compare to sector benchmarks
    - Monitor trends - deteriorating cycle may signal operational issues
    - Balance efficiency with customer service and supplier relationships
