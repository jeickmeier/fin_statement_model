    notes: "- Negative NOI indicates property operating expenses exceed income\n- NOI should be positive and growing over\
      \ time for healthy properties\n- Used as basis for property valuation (NOI / Cap Rate = Property Value)\n- Compare to\
      \ previous periods and market benchmarks\n- Excludes financing, taxes, depreciation, and capex for pure operational\
      \ view\n- Key metric for REIT analysis and property investment decisions\n- Industry standard for measuring property-level\
      \ performance\n- Should be analyzed alongside occupancy rates and rent growth \n"

      - Standard metric defined by NAREIT (National Association of REITs)\n- Adds back depreciation as real estate typically\

      \ for REIT analysis\n- Used for dividend coverage analysis and peer comparisons\n- Should be compared to AFFO for complete\

      - Should grow over time for healthy REIT performance\n- Critical for understanding true cash generation capability \n"
