      \ payout ratio analysis\n- Used for FFO multiple calculations and peer comparisons\n- Focus on growth trends rather\
      \ than absolute levels\n- Consider alongside AFFO per share for complete cash flow picture\n- Standard metric for REIT\

      - Above 2.0x: Very strong coverage, potential for dividend growth\n- Ratio above 1.0x indicates AFFO exceeds dividend\
      \ payments\n- Higher ratios provide more cushion for dividend sustainability\n- Consider alongside growth prospects\

    notes: '- Absolute value depends on property portfolio size and share count

      - Focus on growth trends rather than absolute levels

      - Rising revenue per share indicates portfolio growth or improved performance

      - Should be analyzed alongside occupancy and rent growth metrics

      - Compare to peer REITs with similar property types

      - Consider impact of acquisitions and dispositions on trends

      - Useful for tracking top-line performance on per-share basis

      - Should support FFO and AFFO per share growth over time '
