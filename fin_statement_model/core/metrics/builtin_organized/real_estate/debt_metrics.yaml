# Metric definition for Loan-to-Value Ratio

name: Loan-to-Value Ratio
description: Total debt as a percentage of property value. Key metric for assessing leverage and loan risk in real estate.
inputs:
  - total_debt
  - total_property_value
formula: "total_debt / total_property_value * 100"
tags: [real_estate, debt_analysis, leverage, ltv, loan_risk]
units: percentage
category: real_estate_debt
related_metrics: [debt_service_coverage_ratio, debt_to_equity_ratio, unencumbered_asset_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [50.0, 75.0]
  warning_below: null
  warning_above: 85.0

  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 50%: Conservative leverage, strong equity cushion
    - 50-75%: Typical leverage range for stabilized properties
    - 75-85%: Higher leverage, requires strong cash flows and property quality
    - Above 85%: Very high leverage, significant refinancing and market risk
    - Varies by property type - stabilized assets can support higher LTV
    - Development projects typically require lower LTV due to higher risk
    - Lenders typically cap LTV at 70-80% for permanent financing
    - Consider property quality, location, and cash flow stability
    - Monitor trends - rising LTV may indicate declining property values
