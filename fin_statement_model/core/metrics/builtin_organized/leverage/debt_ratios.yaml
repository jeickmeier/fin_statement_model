# Metric definition for Debt-to-Equity Ratio

name: Debt-to-Equity Ratio
description: Measures the relative proportion of debt and equity financing. Higher ratios indicate greater financial leverage and risk.
inputs:
  - total_debt
  - total_equity
formula: "total_debt / total_equity"
tags: [leverage, solvency, capital_structure, credit_risk]
units: ratio
category: leverage
related_metrics: [debt_ratio, equity_ratio, times_interest_earned, debt_service_coverage]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.3, 0.6]
  warning_above: 1.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  warning_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.3: Conservative capital structure, may be underleveraged
    - 0.3-0.6: Balanced capital structure with moderate leverage
    - 0.6-1.0: Higher leverage, acceptable for stable cash flow businesses
    - 1.0-2.0: High leverage, requires strong cash flows and stable operations
    - Above 2.0: Very high leverage, significant financial risk
    - Industry and business model significantly impact acceptable levels
    - Consider debt maturity profile and interest coverage alongside this ratio 
# Metric definition for Debt-to-Assets Ratio

name: Debt-to-Assets Ratio
description: Measures the percentage of assets financed by debt. Lower ratios indicate more conservative capital structure and lower financial risk.
inputs:
  - total_debt
  - total_assets
formula: "total_debt / total_assets"
tags: [leverage, solvency, capital_structure, asset_financing]
units: ratio
category: leverage
related_metrics: [debt_to_equity_ratio, debt_to_capital_ratio, financial_leverage_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.2, 0.4]
  warning_above: 0.6
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  warning_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.2: Very conservative capital structure, may be underleveraged
    - 0.2-0.4: Balanced capital structure with moderate debt financing
    - 0.4-0.6: Higher leverage, acceptable for stable cash flow businesses
    - 0.6-0.8: High leverage, requires strong asset base and cash flows
    - Above 0.8: Very high leverage, significant financial risk
    - Shows what percentage of assets are financed through borrowing
    - More intuitive than debt-to-equity for understanding asset financing
    - Industry context is crucial - capital-intensive industries typically higher 
# Metric definition for Debt-to-Capital Ratio

name: Debt-to-Capital Ratio
description: Measures the proportion of total capital that comes from debt financing. Shows capital structure composition.
inputs:
  - total_debt
  - total_equity
formula: "total_debt / (total_debt + total_equity)"
tags: [leverage, capital_structure, debt_financing, solvency]
units: ratio
category: leverage
related_metrics: [debt_to_equity_ratio, debt_to_assets_ratio, financial_leverage_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.2, 0.4]
  warning_above: 0.6
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  warning_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.2: Very conservative capital structure, minimal debt financing
    - 0.2-0.4: Balanced capital structure with moderate debt component
    - 0.4-0.6: Higher debt financing, acceptable for stable businesses
    - 0.6-0.8: High debt component, requires strong cash flows
    - Above 0.8: Very high debt financing, significant financial risk
    - Shows what percentage of total capital comes from debt
    - Always between 0 and 1, making it intuitive to interpret
    - Useful for comparing capital structures across companies
    - Consider alongside coverage ratios for complete risk assessment
 
# Metric definition for Financial Leverage Ratio

name: Financial Leverage Ratio
description: Measures assets per dollar of equity, indicating the degree of financial leverage. Component of ROE analysis via DuPont framework.
inputs:
  - total_assets
  - total_equity
formula: "total_assets / total_equity"

  good_range: [1.5, 3.0]
  warning_above: 5.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  warning_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 1.5: Very conservative capital structure, minimal leverage
    - 1.5-3.0: Moderate leverage, balanced capital structure
    - 3.0-5.0: Higher leverage, requires strong cash flows
    - Above 5.0: High leverage, significant financial risk
    - Shows how many dollars of assets per dollar of equity
    - Component of DuPont ROE analysis (ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage)

    - Consider alongside debt ratios for complete leverage picture
