# Metric definition for Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio

name: Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio
description: Measures leverage adjusted for cash position. More accurate representation of financial risk than gross debt ratios.
inputs:
  - net_debt
  - total_equity
formula: "net_debt / total_equity"
tags: [leverage, solvency, capital_structure, net_leverage, credit_risk]
units: ratio
category: leverage
related_metrics: [debt_to_equity_ratio, net_debt_to_ebitda, debt_to_assets_ratio]

  notes: |
    - Below 0.2: Very conservative net leverage, strong cash position
    - 0.2-0.5: Moderate net leverage, balanced capital structure
    - 0.5-1.0: Higher net leverage, acceptable for stable cash flow businesses
    - 1.0-2.0: High net leverage, requires strong cash generation
    - Above 2.0: Very high net leverage, significant financial risk
    - More accurate than gross debt ratios as it considers cash offset
    - Negative values indicate net cash position (cash > debt)
    - Particularly relevant for companies with significant cash holdings

inputs:
  - net_debt
  - ebitda
formula: "net_debt / ebitda"
tags: [leverage, credit_analysis, debt_capacity, cash_earnings, repayment_ability]
units: times
category: leverage
related_metrics: [total_debt_to_ebitda, net_debt_to_equity_ratio, ebitda_interest_coverage]

name: Total Debt-to-EBITDA
description: Measures years required to pay off total debt from EBITDA generation. Conservative debt capacity metric that ignores cash position.
inputs:
  - total_debt
  - ebitda
formula: "total_debt / ebitda"
tags: [leverage, credit_analysis, debt_capacity, gross_leverage, cash_earnings]
units: times
category: leverage

  good_range: [1.5, 4.0]
  warning_above: 5.0

    - Standard metric in loan covenants and credit agreements
    - Consider alongside net debt ratio for complete picture
    - Industry context crucial - regulated utilities can support higher ratios 
# Metric definition for EBITDA-to-Assets

name: EBITDA-to-Assets

inputs:
  - ebitda
  - total_assets
formula: "ebitda / total_assets"

  poor_below: 0.02
  notes: |
    - Below 2%: Very poor cash generation from assets
    - 2-5%: Low cash productivity, potential operational issues
    - 5-10%: Adequate cash generation for many capital-intensive industries

    - More relevant than ROA for capital-intensive businesses
