# Valuation metrics: enterprise_multiples

# Metric definition for EV/EBITDA

name: EV/EBITDA
description: Enterprise value multiple that measures company valuation relative to cash earnings. Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures.
inputs:
  - enterprise_value
  - ebitda
formula: "enterprise_value / ebitda"
tags: [valuation, enterprise_multiple, capital_structure_neutral, cash_earnings]
units: times
category: valuation
related_metrics: [price_to_earnings_ratio, ev_sales, ev_ebit]
interpretation:
  good_range: [8.0, 15.0]
  warning_below: 3.0
  warning_above: 25.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 3x: May indicate undervaluation, distress, or cyclical low
    - 3-8x: Low valuation, potential value opportunity
    - 8-15x: Reasonable valuation for most mature companies
    - 15-25x: High valuation, requires strong growth or market position
    - Above 25x: Very high valuation, speculative or exceptional growth expectations
    - Capital structure neutral - useful for M&A analysis
    - Better than P/E for highly leveraged companies
    - EBITDA proxy for cash generation before capital allocation decisions
    - Consider cyclicality - use normalized EBITDA for cyclical businesses
    - Industry-dependent - compare to sector benchmarks 
# Metric definition for EV/Sales

name: EV/Sales
description: Enterprise value multiple relative to revenue. Capital structure neutral valuation metric useful for M&A analysis.
inputs:
  - enterprise_value
  - revenue
formula: "enterprise_value / revenue"
tags: [valuation, enterprise_multiple, revenue_multiple, ma_analysis]
units: times
category: valuation
related_metrics: [ev_ebitda, price_to_sales_ratio, ev_ebit]
interpretation:
  good_range: [1.0, 4.0]
  warning_below: 0.5
  warning_above: 8.0
  excellent_above: null
  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 0.5: Very low enterprise revenue multiple, potential distress
    - 0.5-1.0: Low valuation, value opportunity or cyclical industry
    - 1.0-4.0: Reasonable enterprise revenue multiple for most industries
    - 4.0-8.0: High multiple, requires strong margins or growth prospects
    - Above 8.0: Very high multiple, exceptional growth or speculative
    - Capital structure neutral - useful for comparing leveraged companies
    - Better than P/S for M&A analysis as it includes debt assumption

  poor_below: null
  notes: |
    - Below 5x: Very low operating earnings multiple, potential distress
    - 5-10x: Low valuation, value opportunity or cyclical low
