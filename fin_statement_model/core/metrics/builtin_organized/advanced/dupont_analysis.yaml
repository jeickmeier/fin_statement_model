    notes: "- Should equal direct ROE calculation (net_income / total_equity)\n- Three components: Net Margin × Asset Turnover\
      \ × Financial Leverage\n- Net Margin shows profitability efficiency\n- Asset Turnover shows asset utilization efficiency\n\
      - Financial Leverage shows capital structure impact\n- Helps identify which factor drives ROE performance\n- High ROE\
      \ from leverage may indicate higher risk\n- Sustainable ROE typically comes from margins and turnover\n- Compare components\
      \ to industry benchmarks\n- Useful for identifying improvement opportunities \n"

  inputs:

    notes: "- Should equal direct ROE calculation (net_income / total_equity)\n- Five components: Tax Burden × Interest Burden\
      \ × Operating Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage\n- Tax Burden: (1 - effective tax rate) shows tax efficiency\n\
      - Interest Burden: Shows impact of interest expense on earnings\n- Operating Margin: Shows operational profitability\n\
      - Asset Turnover: Shows asset utilization efficiency\n- Financial Leverage: Shows capital structure impact\n- More detailed\
      \ analysis than 3-step DuPont\n- Helps isolate operational vs. financial performance\n- Useful for identifying specific\
      \ improvement areas \n"
