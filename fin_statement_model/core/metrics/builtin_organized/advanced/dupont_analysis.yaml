# Metric definition for ROE DuPont 3-Step

name: ROE DuPont 3-Step
description: Three-factor decomposition of ROE into Net Margin, Asset Turnover, and Financial Leverage. Shows ROE drivers.
inputs:
  - net_income
  - revenue
  - total_assets
  - total_equity
formula: "(net_income / revenue) * (revenue / total_assets) * (total_assets / total_equity)"
tags: [dupont_analysis, roe_decomposition, profitability_analysis, leverage_analysis]
units: ratio
category: dupont_analysis
related_metrics: [return_on_equity, roe_dupont_5_step, net_profit_margin, asset_turnover, financial_leverage_ratio]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.15, 0.25]
  warning_below: 0.08
  warning_above: 0.30
  excellent_above: 0.20
  poor_below: 0.05
  notes: |
    - Should equal direct ROE calculation (net_income / total_equity)
    - Three components: Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
    - Net Margin shows profitability efficiency
    - Asset Turnover shows asset utilization efficiency
    - Financial Leverage shows capital structure impact
    - Helps identify which factor drives ROE performance
    - High ROE from leverage may indicate higher risk
    - Sustainable ROE typically comes from margins and turnover
    - Compare components to industry benchmarks
    - Useful for identifying improvement opportunities 
# Metric definition for ROE DuPont 5-Step

name: ROE DuPont 5-Step
description: Five-factor decomposition of ROE including Tax Burden, Interest Burden, Operating Margin, Asset Turnover, and Financial Leverage.
inputs:
  - net_income
  - income_before_tax
  - ebit
  - revenue
  - total_assets
  - total_equity
formula: "(net_income / income_before_tax) * (income_before_tax / ebit) * (ebit / revenue) * (revenue / total_assets) * (total_assets / total_equity)"
tags: [dupont_analysis, roe_decomposition, comprehensive_analysis, profitability_drivers]
units: ratio
category: dupont_analysis
related_metrics: [return_on_equity, roe_dupont_3_step, operating_profit_margin, times_interest_earned]
interpretation:
  good_range: [0.15, 0.25]
  warning_below: 0.08
  warning_above: 0.30
  excellent_above: 0.20
  poor_below: 0.05
  notes: |
    - Should equal direct ROE calculation (net_income / total_equity)
    - Five components: Tax Burden × Interest Burden × Operating Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
    - Tax Burden: (1 - effective tax rate) shows tax efficiency
    - Interest Burden: Shows impact of interest expense on earnings
    - Operating Margin: Shows operational profitability
    - Asset Turnover: Shows asset utilization efficiency
    - Financial Leverage: Shows capital structure impact
    - More detailed analysis than 3-step DuPont
    - Helps isolate operational vs. financial performance
    - Useful for identifying specific improvement areas
