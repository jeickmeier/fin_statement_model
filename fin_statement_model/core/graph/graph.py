"""Public Graph class composed from specialised mix-ins.

This file used to contain the full implementation (>1 000 LOC).  That logic has
been extracted into compact mix-ins under ``fin_statement_model.core.graph.components``.
Keeping this thin fa√ßade here preserves the public import path
``fin_statement_model.core.graph.graph.Graph`` while satisfying the < 500 LOC
