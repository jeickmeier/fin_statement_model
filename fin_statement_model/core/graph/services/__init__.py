"""Service layer for `fin_statement_model.core.graph`.

This sub-package groups **graph-agnostic utilities** that are reused by the
high-level `Graph` fa√ßade but do **not** depend on its concrete implementation.
Keeping stateful concerns (period management, calculation caching, etc.) in
dedicated services improves testability, maintainability, and allows future
graphs or pipelines to compose only the pieces they need.
