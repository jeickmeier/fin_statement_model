# Composite namespace for IO mixins.

"""Composite namespace for IO mixins.

This package progressively extracts the very large legacy *mixins.py* module
into smaller, thematic sub-modules.  External import paths remain stable::

    from fin_statement_model.io.core.mixins import FileBasedReader, handle_read_errors

Nothing outside *io.core.mixins* should import the private ``_legacy_mixins``
module directly â€“ it exists only for the migration window.
