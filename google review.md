Okay, I've reviewed the fin_statement_model codebase. It's a comprehensive library with a lot of functionality. Here's a detailed breakdown of potential areas for improvement, categorized as requested:
Code Review: fin_statement_model
I. Duplicate Code
_get_mapping in io/formats/api/fmp.py and io/formats/excel/reader.py:
Observation: Both FmpReader and ExcelReader have a _get_mapping method that uses normalize_mapping from io.core.utils. The core logic is very similar: get mapping_config from self.cfg and then call normalize_mapping.
Suggestion: This logic could potentially be moved to a mixin or a shared utility if more readers adopt this pattern. However, given they are only two and the context key (statement_type) is specific, the current duplication is minor and might be acceptable for clarity within each reader.
Standard Node Registry Loading (core/nodes/standard_registry.py):
Observation: load_from_yaml and load_from_yaml_file are very similar. load_from_yaml clears existing data, while load_from_yaml_file appends/overwrites. The core loop for processing nodes from the loaded YAML data is nearly identical.
Suggestion: Refactor to have a private helper method like _load_nodes_from_data(self, data: dict, source_description: str) -> int that takes the parsed YAML data and processes it. The public methods can then call this helper, with load_from_yaml clearing the registry first.
_validate_api_key in io/formats/api/fmp.py:
Observation: This method makes a test API call to validate the key. If other API readers are added (e.g., for other data providers), similar validation logic might be needed.
Suggestion: If more API readers are planned, consider a base ApiReader class that could include this validation logic, or a utility function. For now, with only FMP, it's fine.
Error Handling in io/core/facade.py (read_data and write_data):
Observation: The try-except blocks in read_data and write_data have a similar structure for catching IOError, FormatNotSupportedError, and then a generic Exception.
Suggestion: This is a common pattern and generally acceptable for facade functions. No immediate refactoring needed unless it becomes much more complex.
_resolve_display_scale_factor and _resolve_units in statements/formatting/formatter.py:
Observation: These methods have a very similar hierarchical lookup pattern (item -> parent section -> statement -> config default).
Suggestion: A generic helper function _resolve_hierarchical_attribute(self, item, attribute_name, config_path, default_value) could be created to reduce this duplication.
setup_method and teardown_method in tests/statements/test_standard_node_referencing.py and tests/core/metrics/test_real_estate_metrics.py (and potentially others):
Observation: Tests that modify global registries (like standard_node_registry or metric_registry) often have similar setup/teardown to save and restore the registry's state.
Suggestion: Create a pytest fixture or a context manager that handles saving and restoring the state of these global registries to reduce boilerplate in test files.
II. Unnecessary Code
_metric_names attribute in core/graph/graph.py:
Observation: The _metric_names set is initialized but doesn't seem to be actively used for identifying metric nodes. Metric nodes are now typically identified by having a metric_name attribute (often set when graph.add_metric is called). get_available_metrics also relies on this attribute.
Suggestion: Verify if _metric_names is truly unused and remove it if so. Ensure get_available_metrics and get_metric correctly identify metric nodes based on their attributes.
_calculation_methods in core/node_factory.py vs. core/calculations/Registry:
Observation: NodeFactory._calculation_methods maps string keys (e.g., "addition") to Calculation class names (e.g., "AdditionCalculation"). The Registry in core/calculations also stores these mappings. The factory then uses its map to look up the class name and then gets the class from the Registry.
Suggestion: The NodeFactory could potentially directly use the Registry.get(calculation_class_name) if the calculation_type passed to create_calculation_node was the class name itself, or if the Registry could also map simple keys like "addition" to classes. This might simplify the indirection. However, the current setup allows NodeFactory to define its own "API" for calculation types, which can be more user-friendly than requiring class names. This is a minor point.
_READER_INIT_KWARGS and _WRITER_INIT_KWARGS in io/core/facade.py:
Observation: These sets are defined but not actually used in the read_data or write_data functions. The Pydantic config models for readers/writers now handle configuration validation.
Suggestion: Remove these unused variables.
_readers and _writers in io/core/registry.py:
Observation: These are exposed as _reader_registry._registry and _writer_registry._registry for "backward compatibility with tests."
Suggestion: If tests can be updated to use the public API (list_readers, list_writers, or _reader_registry.list_formats()), these direct exposures of internal attributes could be removed to improve encapsulation.
io/core/registry_base.py:
Observation: This file defines HandlerRegistry. The file io/core/registry.py also defines an identical HandlerRegistry.
Suggestion: Remove io/core/registry_base.py and have io/core/registry.py be the sole source of HandlerRegistry. Ensure all imports point to the correct location.
_get_builtin_config_package in io/specialized/statements.py:
Observation: The environment variable override logic was removed, making the function very simple.
Suggestion: Could be inlined or kept as a constant if the path is truly fixed. Keeping it as a function is fine for now if there's any chance of future flexibility.
MetricLineItem in statements/structure/items.py:
Observation: MetricLineItem inherits from LineItem and sets node_id=id. It also stores metric_id and inputs.
Suggestion: This is a valid specialization. However, ensure that the node_id=id convention is consistently used by consumers (like IDResolver and ItemProcessorManager) when dealing with metric items. The LineItem's get_resolved_node_id might not be directly applicable or could be overridden if standard_node_ref is never used for MetricLineItem.
_transform_impl in preprocessing/transformers/normalization.py:
Observation: The transform method calls _transform_dataframe, and _transform_impl seems to duplicate the logic of _transform_dataframe for DataFrames. The base DataTransformer.transform calls _transform_impl.
Suggestion: Consolidate the DataFrame transformation logic into one of these methods, likely _transform_impl as per the base class design, and ensure transform correctly calls it. The current transform in NormalizationTransformer only checks isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and then calls _transform_dataframe. It could directly call _transform_impl after the type check.
III. Areas for Refactoring
Configuration Management in config/manager.py (_load_from_env):
Observation: The _load_from_env method has a very long, hardcoded dictionary env_mappings mapping environment variables to nested config paths.
Suggestion:
This mapping could be generated dynamically from the Config Pydantic model itself. Iterate through the model fields and their nested structures to create the expected environment variable names (e.g., FSM_LOGGING_LEVEL from config.logging.level). This would make it more maintainable as the Config model evolves.
Alternatively, define these mappings closer to the respective config models (e.g., LoggingConfig could have a class method to return its env var mappings).
Configuration Decorators in config/decorators.py:
Observation:
uses_config_default and migrate_to_config have very similar purposes. migrate_to_config is essentially a wrapper for applying uses_config_default multiple times.
config_aware_init relies on a hardcoded param_mappings dictionary.
Suggestion:
Consider if migrate_to_config is strictly necessary or if users can just apply uses_config_default multiple times. If kept, ensure its utility is clear.
For config_aware_init, similar to the _load_from_env suggestion, try to make param_mappings more dynamic or defined closer to where the parameters are actually used (e.g., within the classes themselves or their respective config models). This would improve maintainability.
Graph Node Addition in core/graph/graph.py:
Observation:
Graph.add_node has a dual signature for backward compatibility (accepting a Node instance or name, values for creating a FinancialStatementItemNode).
add_calculation, add_metric, add_custom_calculation, add_financial_statement_item all involve adding nodes to self._nodes and potentially updating self._periods.
Suggestion:
For add_node, consider deprecating the shorthand signature over time and encouraging users to use add_financial_statement_item explicitly.
The node addition logic (checking for existing nodes, adding to self._nodes) is common. While GraphManipulator helps, ensure there's no subtle duplication. The cycle detection logic within add_calculation is complex and specific to adding calculation-type nodes.
Statement Configuration Loading in statements/orchestration/loader.py:
Observation: load_build_register_statements is a high-level orchestrator. It creates a default StatementStructureBuilder if one isn't provided.
Suggestion: This is generally fine. Ensure that the default creation of StatementStructureBuilder correctly propagates all relevant validation settings (like enable_node_validation, node_validation_strict, node_validator) from the load_build_register_statements function arguments.
StatementFormatter.generate_dataframe in statements/formatting/formatter.py:
Observation: This method is very long and has many parameters controlling various aspects of formatting and data inclusion. The recursive process_recursive function within it handles the core logic.
Suggestion:
Break down generate_dataframe into smaller, more manageable private methods. For example, separate methods for:
Initializing and resolving default format arguments.
Building the raw row data (the process_recursive part could be its own helper class or set of functions).
Applying scaling.
Applying sign conventions.
Applying contra formatting.
Applying number formatting.
Adding metadata/indicator columns.
Consider using a "formatting context" object to pass around formatting options instead of many individual parameters.
_get_statement_items in io/formats/markdown/writer.py:
Observation: This method is quite complex due to its recursive nature and handling of different item types from the YAML configuration. It essentially re-parses and interprets the statement configuration.
Suggestion: This logic is similar to what StatementStructureBuilder does.
Ideally, the MarkdownWriter should operate on a StatementStructure object (already built by StatementStructureBuilder) rather than re-interpreting the raw config. This would make MarkdownWriter simpler and leverage the already validated and structured representation.
If it must work from raw config, then abstracting the recursive processing into a helper class or more focused functions would improve readability.
_add_nodes_iteratively in io/specialized/graph.py (GraphDefinitionReader):
Observation: This method reconstructs various node types based on a "type" string in the serialized data. It has specific logic for financial_statement_item, formula_calculation, calculation, and forecast nodes. The forecast node reconstruction is particularly complex due to different forecast types and parameters.
Suggestion:
This is a good candidate for the factory pattern. The NodeFactory could be enhanced to support creation from a serialized dictionary definition. Each node type could have a from_dict class method, and the factory would dispatch to the appropriate one.
For forecast nodes, the non-serializable growth_params (like callables for statistical/custom forecasts) are a known limitation. The current warning is appropriate.
_serialize_node in io/specialized/graph.py (GraphDefinitionWriter):
Observation: Similar to the reader, this method has specific logic for serializing different node types.
Suggestion: Each node class could implement a to_dict() method for serialization, making the writer simpler by just calling node.to_dict(). This aligns with how Pydantic models do model_dump().
ItemProcessor._resolve_inputs_with_sign_conventions in statements/population/item_processors.py:
Observation: This method creates intermediate _signed nodes if an input item has sign_convention = -1.
Suggestion: This is an interesting approach. Ensure that these intermediate nodes are clearly managed and don't pollute the graph if they are only temporary aids for a specific calculation. If they are meant to be persistent, their naming and lifecycle should be well-defined. Consider if the CalculationNode itself or the Calculation strategy could handle sign conventions of inputs more directly, potentially avoiding the creation of these intermediate nodes.
Global Registries (metric_registry, standard_node_registry, forecast_registry, io_registry):
Observation: The library uses several global singleton registries. This is a common pattern for plugin-like architectures.
Suggestion: This is generally acceptable. The main consideration is testability. Ensure that tests properly manage the state of these global registries (e.g., by clearing and re-populating them in setup/teardown or using fixtures that provide a clean registry state) to avoid test interference. The current test setup for standard_node_registry in test_standard_node_referencing.py does this well.
core/nodes/__init__.py - Standard Node Loading Logic:
Observation: The logic to load standard nodes from either an "organized structure" or a "flat file" using the _nodes_loaded flag and nested try-except blocks is a bit complex and hard to follow.
Suggestion: Simplify this. Perhaps attempt loading from the primary (organized) location first. If that fails or loads zero nodes, then attempt the fallback (flat file). The _nodes_loaded flag feels like a workaround for a potentially simpler loading sequence.
examples/sector_examples/realistic_banking_analysis.py - create_banking_visualizations:
Observation: This function is very long and handles plotting for multiple different charts.
Suggestion: Break this down. Each chart or type of chart (e.g., CAMELS component trend, stress test bar chart) could be its own helper function. This would make the main function an orchestrator of calls to these plotting helpers.
General Observations & Positives:
Pydantic Usage: Excellent use of Pydantic for configuration models (config/models.py, io/config/models.py, statements/configs/models.py, forecasting/types.py). This provides great validation and clarity.
Registry Pattern: Consistent use of the registry pattern for metrics, IO handlers, forecast methods, and statement structures is a strong architectural choice, promoting extensibility.
Custom Exceptions: Good use of custom exceptions inheriting from FinancialModelError provides better error context.
Separation of Concerns: Generally, there's a good attempt to separate concerns (e.g., core graph logic, IO, statement definitions, forecasting).
Configuration System: The centralized configuration system (fin_statement_model.config) is well-designed, allowing overrides from multiple sources.
UnifiedNodeValidator: This is a powerful and flexible component for ensuring data consistency.
AdjustmentManager: Cleanly handles a complex aspect of financial modeling.
This review should give you a good starting point for further improvements. Prioritize refactoring based on impact on maintainability, readability, and potential for bugs.Okay, I've performed a detailed review of the fin_statement_model codebase. It's a substantial library with a lot of well-thought-out components. My findings are below, categorized as requested.
Code Review: fin_statement_model
I. Duplicate Code
_get_mapping in io/formats/api/fmp.py and io/formats/excel/reader.py:
Observation: Both FmpReader and ExcelReader have a _get_mapping method. While FmpReader._get_mapping loads default mappings from a YAML file and then overlays user config, ExcelReader._get_mapping only uses normalize_mapping on the user-provided config. The core call to normalize_mapping is similar.
Suggestion: If more readers adopt this pattern of potentially statement-type-scoped mappings, a mixin or a helper function in io.core.utils could centralize the logic of calling normalize_mapping with a context key. For now, with only two, it's minor.
Standard Node Registry Loading (core/nodes/standard_registry.py):
Observation: load_from_yaml (which clears existing data) and load_from_yaml_file (which appends/overwrites) share a significant amount of logic for parsing the YAML data and processing node definitions.
Suggestion: Refactor the common processing logic into a private helper method, e.g., _process_yaml_data(self, data: dict, source_description: str) -> int. The public methods would then call this helper, with load_from_yaml clearing the registry first.
Error Handling in io/core/facade.py (read_data and write_data):
Observation: The try-except blocks in read_data and write_data have a similar structure for catching IOError, FormatNotSupportedError, and then a generic Exception, wrapping them into ReadError or WriteError.
Suggestion: This pattern is common for facade functions and is acceptable. No immediate refactoring is strictly necessary unless the error handling becomes significantly more complex or varies more between the two.
Hierarchical Attribute Resolution in statements/formatting/formatter.py:
Observation: _resolve_display_scale_factor and _resolve_units use a similar pattern to look up an attribute: check item, then parent section, then statement, then global config.
Suggestion: Create a generic private helper method like _resolve_hierarchical_attribute(self, item: Union[StatementItem, Section], attribute_name: str, config_path: str, default_value: Any) -> Any to consolidate this lookup logic.
Test Setup/Teardown for Global Registries:
Observation: Several test files (e.g., tests/statements/test_standard_node_referencing.py, tests/core/metrics/test_real_estate_metrics.py) manually save and restore the state of global registries like standard_node_registry or metric_registry.
Suggestion: Create pytest fixtures (e.g., clean_standard_node_registry, clean_metric_registry) that handle the backup and restoration of these registries. This would make tests cleaner and less prone to errors if teardown is missed.
# Example fixture in conftest.py or a shared test utility
@pytest.fixture
def clean_standard_node_registry():
    original_nodes = standard_node_registry._standard_nodes.copy()
    original_alternates = standard_node_registry._alternate_to_standard.copy()
    original_categories = standard_node_registry._categories.copy()
    yield standard_node_registry # Provide the registry to the test
    # Teardown: Restore original state
    standard_node_registry._standard_nodes = original_nodes
    standard_node_registry._alternate_to_standard = original_alternates
    standard_node_registry._categories = original_categories
    standard_node_registry._categories.clear() # if _categories was not copied properly
    for node_def in standard_node_registry._standard_nodes.values():
         standard_node_registry._categories.add(node_def.category)

# In test file:
# def test_something(clean_standard_node_registry):
#     registry = clean_standard_node_registry
#     # ... test logic that modifies the registry ...
Use code with caution.
Python
II. Unnecessary/Unused Code
_metric_names attribute in core/graph/graph.py:
Observation: This attribute is initialized as set() but doesn't appear to be used. Metric nodes are identified by getattr(node, "metric_name", None).
Suggestion: Remove self._metric_names if it's confirmed to be unused.
_READER_INIT_KWARGS and _WRITER_INIT_KWARGS in io/core/facade.py:
Observation: These sets are defined but not used. Configuration is now handled by Pydantic models for each reader/writer.
Suggestion: Remove these unused variables.
io/core/registry_base.py:
Observation: This file defines HandlerRegistry. The file io/core/registry.py also defines an identical HandlerRegistry.
Suggestion: This is a clear duplication. Remove io/core/registry_base.py. Update any imports that might point to it (though it seems io/core/registry.py is the one being used).
_readers and _writers in io/core/registry.py:
Observation: These are exposed as _reader_registry._registry and _writer_registry._registry for "backward compatibility with tests."
Suggestion: If feasible, update tests to use the public API (list_readers(), list_writers(), or _reader_registry.list_formats()). If not, keep them but clearly mark them as internal/deprecated for test use only.
_transform_impl in preprocessing/transformers/normalization.py:
Observation: The NormalizationTransformer.transform() method performs a type check and then calls _transform_dataframe(). The base DataTransformer.transform() calls _transform_impl(). In NormalizationTransformer, _transform_impl seems to duplicate the logic of _transform_dataframe.
Suggestion: Consolidate the DataFrame transformation logic. The _transform_impl method should contain the core transformation logic for DataFrames (and Series if applicable). The public transform method in NormalizationTransformer can then call super().transform(data) after its initial type check, or directly call its own _transform_impl. The current structure is a bit confusing.
CsvReaderConfig.mapping_config and ExcelReaderConfig.mapping_config:
Observation: These are typed as Optional[MappingConfig]. MappingConfig is Union[dict[str, str], dict[Optional[str], dict[str, str]]]. The normalize_mapping utility handles this.
Suggestion: This is fine, but ensure normalize_mapping is robust. The current implementation of normalize_mapping in io/core/utils.py seems to assume the scoped mapping will have None as a key for the default. If None is not present, it treats the whole config as flat. This might be slightly unintuitive if a user provides a scoped map without a None key expecting it to fail or use an empty default. Clarify this behavior or make normalize_mapping stricter about the structure of scoped maps.
ForecastNode._get_growth_factor_for_period in core/nodes/forecast_nodes.py:
Observation: The AverageValueForecastNode implements _get_growth_factor_for_period to return 0.0 and notes "Not used for average value forecasts." Its _calculate_value method indeed doesn't use the growth factor.
Suggestion: This is acceptable as it fulfills the abstract method requirement. No change needed unless the base ForecastNode._calculate_value logic is refactored to not always require a growth factor.
III. Areas for Refactoring
Configuration Management in config/manager.py (_load_from_env):
Observation: The _load_from_env method has a very long, hardcoded dictionary env_mappings mapping environment variables to nested config paths.
Suggestion:
This mapping could be generated more dynamically from the Config Pydantic model itself. Iterate through the model fields and their nested structures to create the expected environment variable names (e.g., FSM_LOGGING_LEVEL from config.logging.level). This would make it more maintainable as the Config model evolves.
Alternatively, define these mappings closer to the respective config models (e.g., LoggingConfig could have a class method or metadata to return its env var mappings).
Configuration Decorators in config/decorators.py:
Observation:
uses_config_default and migrate_to_config have overlapping goals. migrate_to_config is a convenience wrapper.
config_aware_init relies on a hardcoded param_mappings dictionary.
Suggestion:
migrate_to_config is fine as a convenience.
For config_aware_init, similar to the _load_from_env suggestion, try to make param_mappings more dynamic or defined closer to where the parameters are actually used. For example, parameters in __init__ could have a special default value (e.g., a sentinel object) that signals config_aware_init to look up a config path based on the parameter name, or the class itself could provide this mapping.
Graph Node Addition in core/graph/graph.py:
Observation:
Graph.add_node has a dual signature for backward compatibility.
add_calculation, add_metric, add_custom_calculation, add_financial_statement_item all involve adding nodes to self._nodes. The cycle detection logic in add_calculation is complex.
Suggestion:
For add_node, continue to support the dual signature but clearly document the preferred way (passing a Node instance) and the shorthand.
The cycle detection in add_calculation is crucial. It might be beneficial to move the core cycle detection logic to GraphTraverser if it can be generalized, and add_calculation would use it. Currently, it seems specific to the pre-computation context of adding a new calculation.
StatementFormatter.generate_dataframe in statements/formatting/formatter.py:
Observation: This method is very long and has many parameters. The recursive process_recursive function within it is also substantial.
Suggestion:
Break down generate_dataframe into smaller, more focused private methods. For example:
_resolve_formatting_options(...)
_build_statement_rows(graph, id_resolver, adjustment_filter, ...) (which would contain the process_recursive logic)
_apply_dataframe_formatting(df, periods, ...)
Consider a "FormattingContext" object or dataclass to pass around the numerous formatting options instead of many individual parameters.
The process_recursive function could potentially become a method of a helper class dedicated to traversing the StatementStructure and collecting row data.
_get_statement_items in io/formats/markdown/writer.py:
Observation: This method re-parses and interprets the statement configuration YAML to build the Markdown output. This duplicates some of the logic found in StatementStructureBuilder.
Suggestion: Refactor MarkdownWriter to operate on an already built StatementStructure object. The create_statement_dataframe function (or a similar orchestrator) would first build the StatementStructure, then pass it to the MarkdownWriter (or a StatementFormatter that then uses a MarkdownTableRenderer). This promotes SRP and reuses the validated structure.
Node Serialization/Deserialization in io/specialized/graph.py:
Observation: GraphDefinitionReader._add_nodes_iteratively and GraphDefinitionWriter._serialize_node have large if/elif blocks to handle different node types.
Suggestion:
Serialization: Add a to_dict() method to each Node subclass. GraphDefinitionWriter would then call node.to_dict() and add a 'type' key.
Deserialization: Add a from_dict(cls, data: dict, graph_nodes_map: dict) -> Node class method to Node subclasses. GraphDefinitionReader would determine the type from the serialized dict and call the appropriate from_dict method. The graph_nodes_map would be needed to resolve input node dependencies during reconstruction. NodeFactory could be enhanced to assist in this.
ItemProcessor._resolve_inputs_with_sign_conventions in statements/population/item_processors.py:
Observation: This method creates intermediate _signed nodes in the graph if an input item has sign_convention = -1.
Suggestion: This is a valid approach. The main consideration is the lifecycle and visibility of these _signed nodes. If they are purely internal to the calculation of the dependent node, ensure they are not inadvertently exposed or interfere with other operations. An alternative could be for CalculationNode or the Calculation strategies themselves to be aware of input sign conventions, potentially by looking up the sign_convention of their input StatementItems (if the StatementStructure is accessible or if this info is passed down). This would avoid creating extra nodes. However, the current approach is explicit.
core/nodes/__init__.py - Standard Node Loading Logic:
Observation: The logic to load standard nodes from an "organized structure" vs. a "flat file" using the _nodes_loaded flag and nested try-except blocks is a bit convoluted.
Suggestion: Simplify this.
Define a primary loading path (e.g., organized structure).
Define a fallback loading path (e.g., flat file).
In standard_node_registry.py, attempt to load from primary. If it fails or loads 0 nodes, log a warning and attempt to load from fallback.
The core/nodes/__init__.py would then just call a single standard_node_registry.initialize_default_nodes() method (or similar) which encapsulates this primary/fallback logic. The _nodes_loaded flag could be managed internally by the registry.
examples/sector_examples/realistic_banking_analysis.py - create_banking_visualizations:
Observation: This function is very long and handles plotting for multiple different charts.
Suggestion: Break this down. Each chart or type of chart (e.g., a function plot_camels_component_trend(ax, data, title, metric_name), plot_stress_test_bars(ax, data, title, y_label)) could be its own helper function. The main create_banking_visualizations function would then orchestrate calls to these plotting helpers, managing subplot layout.
Centralized Configuration Access in config/utils.py:
Observation: cfg() and get_typed_config() are good utilities. The convenience functions like default_csv_delimiter() are also helpful.
Suggestion: This is well-structured. Ensure that new configuration options are consistently added to config/models.py and, if frequently accessed, consider adding corresponding convenience functions in config/utils.py.
AdjustmentManager._normalize_filter in core/adjustments/manager.py:
Observation: This method is quite complex due to handling various input types for filters (None, AdjustmentFilter, set of tags, callable).
Suggestion: The complexity seems inherent to the flexibility offered. Ensure it's well-tested. One minor point: when a callable is provided, a warning is logged about period context. If the callable filter is a common use case, consider if the callable could optionally accept period as an argument to make it more powerful.
General Positives:
Pydantic Usage: Excellent and consistent use of Pydantic for configuration and data models. This greatly improves robustness and clarity.
Registry Pattern: The registry pattern is well-applied for metrics, IO handlers, forecast methods, and statement structures, making the system extensible.
Custom Exceptions: Good hierarchy of custom exceptions.
Separation of Concerns: Generally good separation (e.g., core graph, IO, statements, forecasting, preprocessing).
Configuration System: The centralized configuration system is powerful.
UnifiedNodeValidator: A key component for data integrity.
AdjustmentManager: Handles a complex but crucial aspect of financial modeling cleanly.
Type Hinting: Good use of type hints throughout the codebase.
This review should provide a solid basis for targeted refactoring and improvements. The library is already quite mature in its design in many areas.
